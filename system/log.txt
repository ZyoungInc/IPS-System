- v0.1b
  Hardware:
    ESP32 peripheral circuit design.-ok
    Deploy to the first device.-ok
  Software:
    Implemented the ESP32 POST request and got the data through the serial port.-ok
    Send data from Arduino to the code for ESP32.-0k
    The basic database structure is established.-ok
    Simple PHP backend to communicate with the database.-ok
    Simple front end chart and back end communication, data visualization. Charts are updated in real time.-ok
    View the raw data feature.-ok
    A mail notification system was deployed.-ok
    Enhanced security, using encrypted transport.-ok
- v0.2b
  Web site:
    fixed some bugs for email system. It is reliable and stable right now, check every 10 minutes. -ok
    Adjusted the back-end execution efficiency, and accelerated the query speed of the database.-ok
    Adjusted the user interface so that each plant displays its own chart.-ok
    Added system upgrade log.-ok
    adjusted UTC time zone to Honolulu time zone.-ok
    fixed some chart bugs.-ok
    Adjusted Arduino's communication protocol with ESP32 to run faster.-ok
    created a new data base for temperature.-ok
-v0.3b-current
    rewrite the ESP32 program for temperature sensor.-ok
    Optimized directory structure, but still compatible with older interfaces.-ok
    (It is expected that the old interface will be removed to reduce the resource footprint after upgrading the ESP program on chamber1.)
    start a new PHP backend to transfer temperature to database.-ok
    add temperature function to main page.-ok
    update the "check status page", it is easier to use right now.-ok
    build two peripheral circuit for new ESP 32.Two ESP circuit boards were solidified.-OK
    temperature program uploaded to ESP.-ok
    rewrite Arduino program to transfer data to ESP module.-ok
    add temperature function to system.-ok
-v0.4b-next version
    There are will no hardware changes in this version, just server optimization and interface adjustments.

  in progress:
    Convert the chart to a line chart.
    adjusted the chart to support multi-chamber.
    Displays multiple data in a single chart.
    Add a filter.
  suspended:
    deploy ESP32 to all of the chambers.-action needed:
      no any more converter, please buy more.
    The data structure has been adjusted so that each flowerpot has its own data.
